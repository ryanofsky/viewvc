<h2>What Is ViewVC?</h2>

<p>ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version
   control repositories.  It generates templatized HTML to present
   navigable directory, revision, and change log listings.  It can
   display specific versions of files as well as diffs between those
   versions.  Basically, ViewVC provides the bulk of the report-like
   functionality you expect out of your version control tool, but much
   more prettily than the average textual command-line program
   output.</p>

<p>Here are some of the additional features of ViewVC:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Support for filesystem-accessible CVS and Subversion repositories.</li>

  <li>Individually configurable virtual host support.</li>

  <li>Line-based annotation/blame display (<em>CVS only</em>).</li>

  <li>Revision graph capabilities (via integration with <a
      href="http://www.akhphd.au.dk/~bertho/cvsgraph/">CvsGraph</a>)
      (<em>CVS only</em>).</li>

  <li>Syntax highlighting support (via integration with <a
      href="http://people.ssh.com/mtr/genscript/">GNU
      enscript</a>).</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bonsai/">Bonsai</a>-like
      repository query facilities.</li>

  <li>Template-driven output generation.</li>

  <li>Colorized, side-by-side differences.</li>

  <li>Tarball generation (by tag/branch for CVS, by revision for
      Subversion).</li>

  <li>I18N support based on the Accept-Language request header.</li>

  <li>Ability to run either as CGI script or as a standalone
      server.</li>
  
  <li>Regexp-based file searching.</li>

  <li>INI-like configuration file (as opposed to requiring actual code
      tweaks).</li>

</ul>

<h2>Migration From SourceForge</h2>

<p>The ViewVC project is in the process of migrating from its previous
   home at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/viewcvs/"
   >SourceForge</a> (where it was known as "ViewCVS" &mdash; maybe
   you've heard of it?).  The following is a checklist of items which
   make up that transition, and indications as to their individual
   completion status:</p>

<p class="preformat">
Tigris.org Setup:
   [X] New project creation - viewvc.tigris.org
   [X] Version control data
   [X] Mailing list membership
   [X] Mailing list archives
   [X] Open issue history
   [X] Open issue attachments
   [X] File downloads
   [X] Announcements

SourceForge cleanup:
   [X] Closing off CVS
   [ ] Announcement about rename
   [X] Closing off the trackers
   [X] Website repointering
