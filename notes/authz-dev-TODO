Here lie TODO items for the authz-dev branch:

  * Need configuration code, mapping root -> vcauth provider name.
    The idea here is that you need only give the name of the Python
    module, ie. "test" or "svnauthz", and ViewVC will expect said
    module to exist as vcauth.MODULENAME.  We'll also need a setting
    for the default vcauth handler (probably per-roottype, actually).

    NOTE: We might want to take this opportunity to rethink the way
    root configuration works altogether.  Do we need a
    viewvc-roots.conf file, complete with a [__defaults__] section and
    then per-root sections, and the configury inside them?

  * Lose the whole "forbidden" thing in favor of a VC-inspecific
    module that denies access to the forbidden paths?

  * Subversion uses path privelege to determine visibility of revision
    metadata.  That logic is pretty Subversion-specific, so it feels like it
    belongs outside the vcauth library as just a helper function in viewvc.py
    or something.  The algorithm is something like this (culled from the
    CollabNet implementation, and not expected to work as edited):

      # Subversion revision access levels
      REVISION_ACCESS_NONE = 0
      REVISION_ACCESS_PARTIAL = 1
      REVISION_ACCESS_FULL = 2
      
      def check_svn_revision_access(request, rev):
        # Check our revision access cache first.
        if request.rev_access_cache.has_key(rev):
          return request.rev_access_cache[rev]

        # Check our cached answer to the question "Does the user have 
        # an all-access or a not-at-all-access pass?"
        if request.full_access is not None:
          return request.full_access \
                   and REVISION_ACCESS_FULL or REVISION_ACCESS_NONE
 
        # Get a list of paths changed in REV.
        ### FIXME:  There outta be a vclib-complaint way to do this,
        ### as this won't work for vclib.svn_ra.
        import svn.fs
        rev_root = svn.fs.revision_root(self.repos.fs_ptr, rev)
        changes = svn.fs.paths_changed(rev_root)
      
        # Loop over the list of changed paths, asking the access question
        # for each one.  We'll track whether we've found any readable paths
        # as well as any un-readable (non-authorized) paths, and quit
        # checking as soon as we know our revision access level.
        found_readable = 0
        found_unreadable = 0
        for path in changes.keys():
          parts = _path_parts(path)
          kind = request.repos.itemtype(parts, rev)
          if kind == vclib.DIR:
            access = request.auth.check_dir_access(parts, rev)
          elif:
            access = request.auth.check_file_access(parts, rev)
          if access:
            found_readable = 1
          else:
            found_unreadable = 1
          # Optimization: if we've found at least one readable, and one
          # unreadable, we needn't ask about any more paths.
          if found_readable and found_unreadable:
            break
          
        # If there are paths but we can't read any of them, no access is
        # granted.
        if len(changes) and not found_readable:
          request.rev_access_cache[rev] = REVISION_ACCESS_NONE
        # If we found at least one unreadable path, partial access is
        # granted.
        elif found_unreadable:
          request.rev_access_cache[rev] = REVISION_ACCESS_PARTIAL
        # Finally, if there were no paths at all, or none of the existing
        # ones were unreadable, grant full access.
        else:
          request.rev_access_cache[rev] = REVISION_ACCESS_FULL
        return request.rev_access_cache[rev]

    The problems are:  where does one hang the revision access cache
    so that it doesn't survive a given request?  On the request, as
    shown in the edited code above?

    Can we actually get a good interface into the vcauth layer for
    asking the all-access / no-access question?  Obviously each vcauth
    provider can cache that value for itself and use it as it deems
    necessary, but ideally the revision access level question will
    want to know if said auth provider was able to answer the question
    and, if so, what the answer was.

    Another off-the-wall idea -- let's just teach Subversion to do
    this calculation as part of a libsvn_repos API.
